{"name":"The Man With The Golden Fun","tagline":"A *dangerously* expensive imbibing game","body":"# THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN FUN\r\n\r\n## CLASSIFIED DRINKS MENU. CLASSIFIED. DRINKS.\r\n\r\nYour cocktail menu for this evening, featuring a veritable smorgasbord of flavours for all discerning palates:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### No, Mr. Bond, I Expect You To Die! ($1,000)\r\n>\r\nA straight-up traditional blend. If you are killed by a Goldeneye plot character, take one drink. Double up your shot if dispatched by a pistol.\r\n\r\n### Jones, Meet Jean Jacques Pilot ($1,000)\r\n>\r\nA springy, light mix that could take the night anywhere. If you kill as an unknown character, designate one drink to a player of your choice. Double up by using a pistol.\r\n\r\n### Thunderball ($2,000)\r\n>\r\nA hot fiery inferno. If you are blown up with an RPG or a grenade, imbibe twice.\r\n\r\n### Oddjob ($2,000)\r\n>\r\nSharp to the taste, with a powerful kick. If killed via a melee attack, you must drink twice.\r\n\r\n### View To A Kill ($2,000)\r\n>\r\nA direct flavour with a crisp aftertaste. If sniped, take two drinks.\r\n\r\n### You Only Live Once ($1,000)\r\n>\r\nIts reputation precedes it. If you commit suicide, take a drink.\r\n\r\n### Dr. Ner ($1,000)\r\n>\r\nAn American favourite. If a player displays a shocking lack of accuracy, they must imbibe once as a penalty for embarrassing Elizabeth herself.\r\n\r\n### Goldfingered ($4,000)\r\n>\r\nStrong, bold, and not for the faint of heart. If you kill with the Golden Gun, then you can designate four drinks, but at least two must be designated to the player you kill. However, if you are killed whilst holding the gun, you must take three drinks.\r\n\r\n### Double Agent (on request)\r\n>\r\nThe game changer. Each time a player is designated, they gain a point. If they save up 15 points, they can choose a player to single out in a brutal 3v1 contest in the next round, in conditions of their choosing. This includes map, modifiers, and player weapons. The chosen player also has their forfeits doubled. To maximise the impact and minimise the damage, the round lasts under two minutes - the length of the esteemed James Bond theme.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ii1tc493bZM\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
